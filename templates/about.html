                    The ELO Rating System is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor.
                </p>
                
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                    The ELO system calculates an expected score for each player based on their current rating. After a game, the actual result is compared with the expected result, and the rating is adjusted accordingly. Players gain more points for beating higher-rated opponents and lose more points when defeated by lower-rated opponents.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Our Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    In our system, all players start with a rating of 1500. The rating changes after each confirmed game, with the amount of change depending on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The difference between the players' ratings</li>
                    <li>The score of the game</li>
                    <li>A K-factor that determines the maximum possible adjustment</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Reporting Games</h3>
                <p>
                    To ensure fair play, all game results must be reported by one player and confirmed by the opponent. This prevents incorrect or fraudulent reports from affecting ratings.
                </p>

                <h3>How to use the system</h3>
                <p>
